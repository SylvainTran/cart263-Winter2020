Project 1: Happiness is Sisyphus?

# Universality angle
Sisyphus is everyone of us. Who has not toiled in vain? For project 1, my objective is to create an experience that makes the user reflect about the meaning of happiness and the place of work in it (main goal), (stretch goal) and the consequences of failure as external events out of a person's locus of control (stretch goal).

To be continued.
