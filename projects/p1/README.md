Project 1: Happiness is Sisyphus?

# Universality angle
Sisyphus is everyone of us. Who has not toiled in vain? For project 1, my objective is to create an experience that makes the user reflect about the meaning of happiness and the place of work in it (main goal), (stretch goal) and the consequences of failure as external events out of a person's locus of control (stretch goal).

To be continued.


# The Butcher Poet
A commentary on the futility of unrequited love and powerless social status

The story is thus: a young man of relative unimportance worked at the Poggy Chops Market as a junior butcher. His days were a blur of chicken, pork and beef butchering, himself being hidden from view to all but the dead that keep him company. He would have all the reasons to leave and seek a less futile existence, but the one thing that keeps him at the job beyond all else: a pretty and fair cashier girl, with eyes and hair of ruby. Therefore our butcher in love seeks, between moments of absolute glorious butchering, the inspiration to send the ruby girl some poetry, made from combining some verbal qualities he finds her to have despite his abject condition. These are sent to her during the break of his shift, and he finds her to be quick to reply, moments later, telling him words of honey but never bringing about love returned. Thus for all eternity, like Sisyphus rolling the boulder up, and restarting again, maybe out of scorn, maybe out of love. For what is unrequited love but the resolute determination of repeating the same act over and over again, yet expecting a different result each time?

This project is a commentary on the futility of unrequited love and powerless social status.
