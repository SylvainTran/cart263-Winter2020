# Commuting is the Unrequited Love

### A game on the floating moment behind the real moment of commuting as a job, and the connection of that invisible job with unrequited love.

Commuting is a universal job, for most people in the lower and middle/working class of modernized societies. Commuting can represent a form of unrecognized, invisible labor, which is the more striking with long commuting hours (>2h daily). To commute requires movement. To commute also requires intentionality or goal planning. These are respectively tied to the naturally provided universal capacity of bipedal movement, which in anthropological studies, is known to have preceded the development of the cerebral cortex. As for the reason behind "getting somewhere to work" in the urbanized world; it is connected with the geographic distribution of urban work following the industrial revolution, making a lot of workers commute to far working locations (like offices) away from home. In the past few decades, some have attempted to reverse this tendency at least partially (e.g., wework) and remote work is also becoming more of a thing in some companies.

This in itself would not constitute a completely satisfying relationship to the theme of Sisyphus, whose boulder-rolling task represents meaningless labor, because commuting serves a purpose after all -- to reach a meaningful place for labor -- but the experience analyzed behind the moment under the moment of commuting, when nothing is do-able (regardless of any entertainment or activity undertaken) except to wait to be somewhere, to be in a different place, to get there in order to start labor for a few mere hours only to start commuting over again; that is the experience that this game experience is targeting. 

The angle behind the necessity of getting in a different place to start a time-dominant activity such as labor, can be applied to seemingly tangential ideas like unrequited love. The perception of the unrequited lover against the object of his affections is that of a time-bound commuter in wait of getting in a certain place in order for the whole experience to be completed. It is unrequited love then, because of the discrepancy or the lag behind being in-wait and the moment of perceived completion or culmination of efforts, which is ultimately tantamounts to repeated but obstinate--even addictive--failure.

### Features

The game wants to capture (if it can even do such a thing) the spatial qualities of the "invisible moment" during commuting using mouse movement constrained in a region while maintaining a visual arc dawning upon the theme in the user's peripheral vision. 

- Dragging the commuting action box advances time.
- Time advances the routine.
- The routine doesn't care if you are experiencing unrequited love. 
- The perceived final destination is ever out of reach.
