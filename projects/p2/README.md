### Description/Intention

### Features

Race/Generative need to produce content of poor and unrelated quality related to original content

  // Fake youtube video list generator?

  // Submersed individual in a larger system

Automated reward systems like YouTube algorithms necessitate exploitation in the same way that capitalism necessitates exploitation
Not in a future of AI overlords and robots in the factories, but right here, now, on your screen, in your living room and in your pocket.

   Modify existing game. Start simple.

   Maybe a colony of ants

   Representation:
    Ants colony workers
      Capitalism exploitation - GOAP

      Start by bringing harmlessly food to colony,
      then queen starts to produce actions like kill other ants
      and chaos ensues

      Something silly about monster bashing
      and the job of it

Essay thesis statement:

Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale, and it forces me to question my own beliefs about the internet, at every level.

  What do you really know about the Internet?
    About who lives in it?
      About what is produced in it?
        About why they are doing it?

          These are all rooms of knowledge.
            Yume nikki style...?
              Interrogate workers in the "Demon-youtube-scape" as they build their devices to mind puppet people on earth
                Do so with voice commands
                Get voice replies from them

              Or
                Infiltrate a youtuber's home, find out it's really a massive corporation 
                  It gets stranger and stranger

                  Or the psychological exploration of motives

                    Or the vocal commanding of robots that produce weird and dark stuff?
