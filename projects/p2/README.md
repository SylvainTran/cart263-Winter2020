# Artist's Statement

Project 2: Something is Wrong on the Internet

World of Youtube

### Description/Intention

World of Youtube was a rather “straightforward” and concrete software exploration of one of the subthemes of James Bridle’s essay, There’s Something Wrong in the Internet. The concept of money and its alleged effects on motivational aspects behind artistic creation in particular was put down in the only real interaction in the software (which you could not really yet consider as a game, probably) that is speech recognition. As with any dialogue that treats with agents in a software through logical decision trees, this is not a real interaction per say but an interface for which we may enable a priori defined lines of speech commands leading into concrete in-software events.
	The representation of World of Youtube was deliberately chosen to be a “childhood game fantasy” -- namely a mimic of early Final Fantasy games in the 8-bit to 16-bit generation, perhaps to capture the “innocence”  and the “fear for our kids nowadays” of which James Bridle’ essay touched upon. My intention was to put speech recognition and responsive voice at the centre of the game’s interactive feature requirement, to make it sound (literally) that your own verbal “spells” (literally) may crucially have an impact on people’s decisions (literally). This aspect was captured mainly in the game’s “fantasy” or concept that you are a lone wizard in search of spellbooks in the game (not yet implemented, however) that will allow you to “command” others. 
	In this short prototype, the only “others” is the clone of yourself in the underground Youtube Creator Studio that is found hidden south east of the world. That clone, is meant to perhaps nudge one gently about the similarity or the thin veil present between “creator/producer” and “artist who does the job” in areas where, let’s be frank, money is involved. (It was also because I ran out of resources quite literally in terms of pixel art assets and time). But nevertheless, we may speak of a big corporation like Google (owning Youtube since 2004) board directions and budget decisions for which the lowly artist (or let’s call them the content producer) working has no tangible “clause of competition” in terms of interests, because they find themselves swaddled in a pool of content for which a certain amount of profitability and, as touched in James’ essay, marketability and not “essence” is the goal for these content producers. The hierarchical, patriarchal aggressiveness of having to best “hot trending” content to survive becoming obsolete and confined to the “youtube vaporware” that failed to deliver is enough incentive for mass generations of disturbing videos that have nothing to do with their content, but rather the circumstances that surround their credo. We may curiously wonder if the violence and graphicness depicted through algorithms in some way reflect the human failure to contain disparate areas of human behaviour for which profit is the main interest, and profit leads to abuse which leads to self-alienation in the end. For the very fact that we are so shocked, distraught and disturbed by the up-and-coming of videos like Peppa Pig Goes to the Dentist, hints to the possibility that we are already alienated from a state of mutual cognizance or “recognition” with what we allow to be produced at our guise, like the impersonal spells of a wizard, while we remain estranged and unaware of our reach in the world, a world teeming with beauty and goodness as well. This “profitable innocence”, like that of an irresponsible wizard adventurer in World of Youtube, is as much, habituation than it is condemnation, for we may find it “good” to displace or project to others rather than see the possibilities that involve our tacit or implicit consent.

### Features
- Explore a top-down world without too much commitment
- Use speech recognition to cast spells
- Generate money by asking for it
- It's basically a fantasy without the hype
- Generate Youtube videos based on the Youtube Keener's alignment (which depends on their bank account) <- This last bit is still in progress
