   3Cs:
        Character
            A manager robot on a quest to deprogram itself.
            (Auto) Generate boxes:
                UX
                    Gets rewarded for creating boxes of hardware.
            Observe:
                UX
                    Player stares at the human manager.
                        This makes the robot anxious himself progressively,
                            which is the goal of the robot (learning to defeat unequanimity)
            Grab: 
                UX
                    Player can grab anything and shake it around.
                        This is a pointless action and has no real intended effect.
        Control
            Move around
                arrow keys or joystick?
