   3Cs:
        Character
            A manager robot on a quest to deprogram itself.
            (Auto) Generate boxes:
                UX
                    Gets rewarded for creating boxes of hardware.
            Observe:
                UX
                    Player stares at the human manager.
                        This makes the robot anxious himself progressively,
                            which is the goal of the robot (learning to defeat unequanimity)
            Grab: 
                UX
                    Player can grab anything and shake it around.
                        This is a pointless action and has no real intended effect.
        Control
            Move around
                arrow keys or joystick?
            Auto-sentience
                Resumes its planned tasks according to rewards
        Camera
            2D view

Stretch:


=======
1.	Narrative: You're a magician that can get things done with voice commands like magic
2.	Fix scene transition (TODO STILL for data passed in previous scene, weird thing happening)
3.	Add voice commands per scene (fitting point 4) OK
4.	Add game mechanic: Give me :amount  of money via Voice Recognition OK but need UI and tie to video generation
5.	Have wannabe youtubers pass in the studio  (FSM) OK - just one
6.	Youtubers have their own bank account (if low on cash will pick up jobs and create mindless content (FSM) - OK but only broke youtubers right now
7.	If high on cash might refuse work (FSM) - Changed version to generate videos
8.	Content is output in a separate parallel scene launched VS. Actual youtube channel opened - OK Videos spawn in html div
