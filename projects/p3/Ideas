TODO

1. Scene transfer effects


2. Add physics collision bounce d3 style to scenes

3. Inception controller vs. scene
    Add the player to the Controller/World scene
    
        Player can jump inside scenes
            Player can pick up things in a scene, and use it to "activate" the paired scene
            or another scene
            
            Player can head back out
            Player can move from scene to scene like so

Sequencing

    Time flows differently inside scenes
    Can interact outside scene too, or be at risk vs. safety
    Can rescue npcs / quests inside special scenes
    scenes can reveal something abou tthe env. or allow the player to solve a puzzle in the World.js scene when placed on drag drop zone
    Animations to climb in and out of scenes
    Puzzle: Paired scenes interact with each other, maybe a scene is a stair and the other a ledge -- or one is a dark room and one is a light room,
    figure out how to make one activate the other
    Player explores in World.js and can pocket scenes for later use or enter / use them immediately in the surrounding environment
