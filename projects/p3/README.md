P3: Questionnaire Hero: The Liker(t)ian Saga

This game is a playful wordplay on the "quest" entity in many rpgs. It's a micro, micro medieval data mining analogue game; a.k.a a social science simulator, in which the player is a court advisor assigned not QUESTS, but QUESTIONNAIRES. (The emphasis is on Likert scales, hence the Liker(t)ian Saga...) 

And so, our hero goes on his quest to fill questionnaires. He is tasked with studying his own explicit (phase 1 of the game) and implicit (phaser 2 of the game) attitudes on subjects concerning the people and animals inhabiting the land.

Except the hero is no hero at all. Instead of saving the world, or slaying demons,
you are tasked with talking to NPCs and replying to their questions over a 4000 tiles wide land. You're paid nil for it too, receiving zero gratitude, but you get a sense of self-importance once you report back with your results at the Tribune Peak.

The intent here was to follow Pippin's idea to take an existing structure of a game, and make a micro variation on it by retelling or experimenting with a new form against the existing game. In this case, it's a JRPG where most of the quest is done over talking and killing monsters. The core action of such games are to walk around doing mostly nothing else but to talk to everyone you meet to get a clue where to go next, and grinding experience and loot to continue to the next stage. These adventuring and grinding element were kept, but the difference was to change the action into something more reflective at a high level than combat.

Scope

In Phase 1, the player explores the land and completes questionnaires.

In Phase 2, the player must report back to court to with the new information.
