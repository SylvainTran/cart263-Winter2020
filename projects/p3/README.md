# Artist's Statement

Project 3:

Libraries:
    Phaser.js
    J-Query/d3-drag/d3-zoom
    Pizzicato.js

### Description/Intention

    Raise awareness on: 
        Global poverty and liminal poverty in the world
        but the worse is poverty of time use in developed countries. Distractions compete to flood our attention and we pay them more than necessary.
        
        The second problem is time boxing. When I go through a project, I rarely find time to put on a project.
            Obviously this is related to motivation, but what if we could make it easier? <- Commentary on the lack of time to complete/commitment
            to play one big game completely <- industry criticism of player's time
            subvert "big open world games" with "pocket-sized bites" that give
            what the player wanted in the first place out of their time: realization and experience
    
    Statistics: 
        Use d3 to show player actions?
