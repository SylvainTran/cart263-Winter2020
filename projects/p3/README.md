P3: Questionnaire Hero: The Liker(t)ian Saga. (Also based on The Dream of a Ridiculous Man by Fyodor Dostoevsky)

# What is the game?

This game is a playful wordplay on the "quest" entity in many rpgs. It's a micro, micro data mining analogue game; a.k.a a social science simulator, in which the player is a court advisor assigned not QUESTS, but QUESTIONNAIRES. (The emphasis is on Likert scales, hence the Liker(t)ian Saga...). It's also a mental landscape about alienation, feeling invisible, and self-deception.

# Why questionnaires? Isn't that the most boring thing to do?

It's the reason why I was interested in putting questionnaires, a seemingly antithetical concept to that of a playful environment like video games. It was a natural progression in the project too. At some point in the previous version, you could click on scenes to choose what to do on them. I realized that was like filling a questionnaire in social science. Which is... a grave thing to realize. Due to my background working in psychological research, I am very acquainted with the idea of using questionnaires to "do" science. The game that emerged in the end, was about how questionnaires interact with the interactee, in the matter of "essence of things" or when trying to poke at the "beast". Who is the questionner? Who made these questions? How do they frame how we view the subject, and ourselves? How does the subject, being subjected to questioning, becomes the reflection of our attitudes--the very ones that we seek to elucidate? Do we really care about who we're actually studying in front of us?

By putting those in a game, maybe one could see the nonsense (or the sense) of this practice, which may be a colonizing thing to do in certain contexts, or a decolonizing endeavor if we spin it around in a game (and ask your professor to execute your ideas infinitely better than you can). These contexts were mapped to the player being able to study different subjects like people, animals and inanimate things. But in the end, it's all the same because *even rocks can *talk* (i.e., communicate) to a motivated question-er, if one is really looking to get a point across or to derive some new meaning or knowledge.

# But... the player answers his own questions when he travels to talk to NPCs

Yes.

# Intentions

And so, our hero goes on his quest to fill questionnaires. He is tasked with studying his own explicit (phase 1 of the game) and implicit (phaser 2 of the game) attitudes on subjects concerning the people and animals inhabiting the land.

Except the hero is no hero at all. Instead of saving the world, or slaying demons, your job is to talk to NPCs and replying to their off-putting questions over a 4000 tiles wide land. You're paid nil for it too, receiving zero gratitude, but you get a sense of self-importance once you report back (somewhere) with what you learned. If it doesn't quite make sense, that's normal -- the game was about a figure trying to find sense desperately when they needed to stay still. That also sort of sounds just like what curiosity and playfulness is. Games. It attempts to be a playful subversion of social science through a *very casual* lense of my own making.

# Reason behind the drastic change in direction

There were essentially two versions to this project as one can read in the commits history. Basically from the start of the project to April 16th, the first iteration was about searching for an idea that I liked about "slice of life" haiku inspired, japanese moments.

I started wanting to make something about ephemeral life moments, just like last year. The reason I transitioned towards a game-based experience was due to reflection about embodiment. In controlling an avatar more closely than by dragging scenes around, it seemed to be getting the feeling of interacting with stuff closer to what I wanted. Also, encountering scenes in the wild seemed cool, but it wasn't a technically feasible or intuitive thing to do with Phaser's scene system mapping multiple cameras against the viewport. At that point, I knew making the transition from interacting with scenes to interacting with game objects to get this "encounter in the wild" was what I needed to do. Also, Dostoevsky.

# Pippin's ideas about micro games and about modifying existing games

Another development intent at the very end here was to follow Pippin's idea to take an existing structure of a game, and make a micro variation on it by retelling or experimenting with a new form against the existing game. In this case, it's a top-down J-RPG where most of the quest is done over talking and exploring the land. Sometimes, the quest also includes killing monsters and characters in a narrative. But the core action of such games is to walk around and press a button to interact with everyone you meet to get a clue where to go next, and also grinding experience and loot to continue the story. These adventuring and grinding element were kept, but the difference was to change the primary action into something different at a high level than combat, which is questionnaire-writing. It's also about looking at how the *meaning of narrative story decisions can change by "making choices" through a self-reflected attitude questionnaire (Likert scale) rather than an actual RPG style decision to make in a game moment.

# Final thoughts post-mortem

The most valuable thing out of this project for me was the learning experience. Because I changed direction at the end, something that I'm proud of, the thing is not as polished as I could have if I had stuck to one idea from the get go. But that's just how the process is. I think we're supposed to change our minds as we go. The analogy is clay shaping, which is another of my hobbies. In the end, the clay was shaped through code and as far as I'm concerned I think there's a clay pot on the table. I learned a lot about Javascript, refactorings, organization and project development, my personal flaws and style in code and design, the danger of being a wannabe engineer craftsman when still early in the learning curve, the problems of using existing technologies and plugins that fail you at the very end, the disillusionment behind not testing early on the feasibility of a technical idea with the technologies you have, and especially the knowledge you have, and the fact that some very simple solutions are better than complex ones. I like the end result of subconscious amalgation of ideas about interactivity and life moments into this weird idea about questionnaires, something that I think is worth to look into more deeply at some point.

# Features and Scope

In Phase 1, the player explores the land and completes questionnaires.

In Phase 2, the player must report back to court to with the new information.

#Stretch: Results become more meaningful with regards to the game's story.
