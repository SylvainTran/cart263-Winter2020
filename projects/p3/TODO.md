Artist's Statement
    
    In our generation, a lot of video games are open-world, progress-based,
    and require hours upon hours of work...play to get to the "fun parts".

    Meanwhile, many things compete for our attention and time, and poverty of time
    resources is a big issue for people living in developed countries. 

    The opposite of this is time binging "marathons" on a particular activity or entertainment content. 

    Outside of entertaining oneself, focusing on achieving something for yourself to land a good career or a stable income, or get rewarded with other things, may make one
    fail to see the bigger picture.

    Kubernetes is a commentary about those pocket sized moments of enjoyment
    that people may be looking for in video games, or in activities in a broader sense,
    given without further ado.

    The game attempts to make the player connect moments together admist various moment competitors to create a non-linear experience and invites them to reflect about one's time usage.

    The "tapestry" of moments or the network of moments is also data visualization of
    time spent and "earned" in video games. 
    
    The game is an exploration of that big picture of our time spending, but also the linearity of how we decide to enter a game designer's vision or creation, and somehow take control of the granularity of the sensuous experience or representation of ideas that are communicated by the designed systems in place.

Things to fix

    Creating a link and then moving away does not refresh the controller's cache
    and the link button should disappear knowing this

    Leavning snap range and getting back to the same closest neighbour does not re-enter snap state
