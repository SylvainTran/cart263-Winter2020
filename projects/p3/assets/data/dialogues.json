But now I do not resent it, they are all dear to me now, even when they\nlaugh at me -and, indeed, it is just then that they are\nparticularly dear to me. I could join in their laughter--not\nexactly at myself, but through affection for them, if I did\nnot feel so sad as I look at them. Sad because they do not\nknow the truth and I do know it. Oh, how hard it is to be\nthe only one who knows the truth! But they won't understand\nthat. No, they won't understand it.", "TEST"],
